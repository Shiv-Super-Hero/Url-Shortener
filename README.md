# Url-Shortener
This project is a secure URL Shortener application built using Spring Boot and Spring Security with JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication.
It allows users to register, log in, and create shortened URLs while ensuring all operations are protected through JWT-based authorization.
The project demonstrates how to combine REST API development, security mechanisms, and token-based authentication in a clean and modular way.
The SecurityFilterChain ensures that every request passes through JWT validation before accessing any secured resource.
By combining URL shortening logic with robust security, the project highlights real-world application of authentication, authorization, and secure API design in Spring Boot.
